MVI Gihub Client


- A means of studying different implementations of MVI.
- Seperate branches will exist which will investigate different styles of MVI implementation.
- I intend to copy first the example on the raywendelich.com MVI course. Followed by Kaushik Gopal's
  version that he previously mentioned on the Fragmented podcast. And finally I will Implement the MVI
  example created in the Caster.io course.
- All implementations are slightly different hopefully from playing around with each on I will find
  the implementation I like the most or create my own hybrid of the ideas in each.
